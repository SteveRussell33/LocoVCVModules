# Loco Modules

A collection of VCVRack modules by Luke Perkin.

## TEX
Load and image and then sample a pixel, the module will convert colour information of that pixel to CV.
The module is polyphonic so you can sample multiple pixels at once.

## CHAOS
Simulates a double pendulum and outputs CV for different properties of the two pendulums.
The output is a polyphonic cable with 6 channels (Pendulum 2 x, Pendulum 2 y, Pendulum 1 theta, Pendulum 2 theta, Pendulum 1 velocity, Pendulum 2 velocity).
